INTRODUCTION SECTION-1

-> When we ask any java developer, what actually a maven is?, ususlly we get an answer saying
   it is used in build tool, and dependency management.
-> So my question is is this the main purpose of maven?
-> no, these are not the main purpose of maven instead it is used as project management tool.
-> Let us know how to manage a java project.
-> actually there is no concept of project in java, instead it is just the group of classes.
-> so what actually a term java project have i.e the structure:
     -> source code
     -> Test code
     -> Project Structure(directories,assests,resources)
     -> libraries and dependencies
     -> configuration
     -> Task manager
     -> reporting
-> So how maven come in to picture?
   -> maven is going to tell us where actually the source code is,the Test code.....
   -> it actually manages the java project and it will group all java project needs using a concept
      called project object model.
-> maven
       -> provides project stucture and manages it.
       -> helps managing dependencies 
       -> configurable project object model
-> characteristics:
       -> maven has its own conventions which we have to use, if our project is built based on these
          conventions then we need not have to configure.
       -> even then maven provides the option to configure things.
       -> It is DE agnostic, that is it doest require any IDE, but it is IDE supported.
       -> Declarative dependency management, i.e we can declare some task to be done and the 
          maven will do it for us.
       -> the main thing about maven is, it is a plugin based architecture, where plugins will provide
          additional functionality to maven.

Working on some concepts like,creating a maven project, working on dependencies and plugins, working with JDBC using maven, and creating a war file
and deploying on tomcat is been done.
The worked examples with the outputs screenshots are shown there in each respective folders.
